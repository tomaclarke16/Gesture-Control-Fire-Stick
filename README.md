# Gesture-Control-Fire-Stick
This is a python project that allows users to control basic amazon fire tv functions with gesture control. It incorporates a few of the fire tv remote buttons, and it customisable to change what each of these functions will do. 
Gesture control is designed using mediapipe and openCV, and fire stick control is based on adb debugging.
You can change or add as many functions as you wish, this is a basic outline to demonstrate the potential.
